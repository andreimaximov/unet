# Sets up a Linux TAP device + Ethernet bridge. Couples of notes on this...
#
# 1) Our topology looks roughly like so...
#
#    [     Dev @ 10.255.255.102/24     ]  <->  [           VM tap0           ]
#                                                             |
#                                              [ VM br0 @ 10.255.255.101/24  ]  <->  [ VM IP Forwarding ]
#                                                             |                               |
#    [ Host vboxnet0 @ 10.255.255.1/24 ]  <->  [           VM eth1           ]                |
#                                                                                             |
#    [             Host @ ?            ]  <--------------------------------------->  [    VM eth0 @ ?   ]
#
#    Here "Dev" is our usrnet device which runs in a user process on the VM. The
#    Vagrantfile configures a private 10.255.255.0/24 subnet for communication
#    between the host, VM, and this device.
#
#    In this script we create br0, a bridge between tap0 and eth1. This enables
#    communication on the 10.255.255.0/24 subnet but not outside it to the general
#    internet. Thus we enable routing via the "nat" table for the 10.255.255.0/24
#    subnet and use br0 (10.255.255.101/24) as a default gateway for Dev! In effect,
#    packets arriving at br0 (out default gateway) are forwarded to the internet via
#    eth0.
#
# 2) The tap0 will only receive frames if it is UP. As of Linux kernel 2.6.36 TAP
#    interfaces are UP only if a program has opened the interface. You can use
#    "cargo run --example dev_up" to bring tap0 UP.
#
# 3) Do not use the same MAC address for Dev as tap0. Otherwise br0 swallows frames
#    (or something like that...).

if [ -d /sys/class/net/tap0 ]; then
    exit 0
